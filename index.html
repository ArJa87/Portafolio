                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Civil Engineer that is learning to code because of family matters that requires me to stay in house or at least be close to it most of the time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the time came to select a new career, i tought of coding as a posibility mostly because is something a have always been interested in, and now that i've started this road i'm happy to see that is just as i tought an interesting field.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed working in computers and been a part of geek culture so this suits me better than i initialy tought, i will keep learning an improving as fast as i can using what i've learn from my first career as a basis, since i noticed how similar parts of them are and is something that drives me forward.  
                </p>
